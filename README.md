# Personal Finance

A collaborate project between [koloktos](https://github.com/koloktos) and [programmer1718](https://github.com/programmer1718/).

The goal is to develop a web application for tracking financial activity across multiple accounts without the need for manual input.

We are using the [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) [Node.js library](https://github.com/plaid/plaid-node) for obtaining financial data from financial institutions.
